The task of this project is to program a simple method for searching similar images. By similar images, we mean images that resemble each other in terms of the content they present and their visual appearance, colors and textures (for example, images showing sunsets). Images that are similar to a query image will be found using color histogram intersection. 

Programs are written under different paradigms: Java, Scheme, Prolog, and Go.
