I have created the following functions in my Scheme code:

;;Constructs a histogram list from an inputted histogram txt file
(define (readHistogram filename)

;; Returns the normalized histogram, such that the values of all bins sum to 1.0
(define (normalizeHistogram hist)

;; Returns the intersection between two histograms
(define (getIntersection hist1 hist2)

;; Checks if a file is a txt file or not (ends with ".txt")
(define (isTxtFile filename)

;; Sorts all of the intersection values in descending order
(define (sortIntersections intersectionVals)

;; Retrieves all txt files from the image dataset
;; Returns the filename and its histogram
(define (getDatasetHistograms dataset)

;; Main function
;; Returns the top 5 most similar images to the query histogram
(define (similaritySearch queryFilename dataset)

;; For running all query files at once
(define queryFilenames '("queryImages/q00.jpg.txt" ... "queryImages/q15.jpg.txt"))
